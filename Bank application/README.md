# Banking application

This is a simple terminal banking application with an ASCII art GUI.
In Croatian, the PIN (personal identity number) is called OIB and contains precisely 13 digits.
For every account created you need to enter the data being asked of You and Your PIN should be 
a 13 digit number. Croatian version of the program has some quirks and uses the old currency, Croatian Kuna (HRK) which was changed to United States dollar (USD) in the English version.

Except for translation the English version is also refactored and slightly improved.
Any future programs with proper GUI and SQL database will be built upon that version.
